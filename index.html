            <p>As you may have concluded from the article intro, the definition
              of electronic dance music is a simple one. Often abbreviated to
              EDM, electronic dance music boils down to "all music produced
              electronically for people to dance to". See what we did there?
              Electronic(ally produced) dance(able) music. That's all. It’s that
              simple!</p>
            <p>Keeping the above definition in mind, we can trace the origin of
              electronic dance music back to Jamaica in the 1960s. The artists
              there tried to create new forms of music by overlapping multiple
              tracks on reel-to-reel audio tape recorders. This certain style of
              music, which was called dub music, became popular in night clubs
              and bars and was essentially the first form of electronic dance
              music, even preceding disco.</p>
            <p>In the 1970s, when the disco era started coming to an end, a
              similar thing occurred. A man called Frankie Knuckles tried to
              recreate tracks and sounds by fusing various genres, adjusting the
              tempo and adding percussion. House music was born, a style of
              music so infectious it soon spread to the rest of the world.
              Within a next few decades, countless new genres popped up within
              the electronic dance music spectrum. And now, EDM is one of the
              most thriving and popular entities in the entire music landscape.</p>
            <p>A great way to measure the popularity of genres within electronic
              dance music throughout the years is to run through the results of
              all annual DJ Mag Top 100 polls. You’ll notice that the popularity
              gradually shifted from credible (now old-skool) house to the more
              hands-up, festival-oriented sound (progressive house/big room)
              once EDM started crossing over into pop culture more.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>
              While the term "EDM" has been a buzz term for the last few years,
              electronic dance music has been here for decades. And no matter
              how you slice it, we can't see the term EDM and lump every style
              and artist that puts out electronic music into one pot. It does a
              disservice to the individuals making the music, and the people who
              have been documenting the music. We're at a crossroads, though; we
              are documenting the EDM scene, but want people to know that the
              world of electronic dance music is more than just the DJs on the
              Ultra main stage.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can't really blame the outside media for any confusion with
              the term EDM, though - if no one is giving them a simple guide to
              differentiate dubstep from house, how can you get so cross when
              they mess a term up? The onus is on us to provide them with some
              guidance. And while this guide isn't a complete beginning-to-end
              picture of each genre, we've provided snapshots of each of the
              more popular styles of EDM for those seeking guidance to explore,
              to make more informed choices for festivals, or just to avoid
              embarrassment in conversation. In this guide, you'll find some of
              the most well-known genres in EDM today, with a listing of notable
              subgenres, artists, and labels within each, as well as examples
              (both old and new) of each genre's sound. Take your time and enjoy
              your journey through our comprehensive guide of EDM genres.
