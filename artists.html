              <p>
                Tim Bergling, AKA Avicii, was a Swedish musician and D.J. with
                several hit records in his discography. He was born on September
                8, 1989, in Stockholm. His mother was an actress, while his
                father ran an office supply store. Bergling was born into a
                comfortable family of six. He had three siblings, one of whom
                was actor Anton Korberg. He was of Swedish descent and a Virgo
                by design. Bergling started mixing sounds at eight, and by 16,
                he fully began making music.</p>

              <p>
                In 2007, Bergling signed to the Dejfitts Plays label and adopted
                the stage name Avicii soon after. From 2009 to 2010, he became
                an amazing record producer and was releasing music quickly.
                Bergling released his hit song, ‘Seek Bromance,’ in 2010, and it
                peaked on the charts of several countries. He signed with E.M.I.
                Music Publishing the same year. In 2011, with the release of
                ‘Levels,’ Bergling became mainstream. The song reached the
                top-10 position in multiple countries, from Croatia to Belgium,
                Slovenia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Sweden, etc. Bergling
                collaborated with David Guetta and released ‘Sunshine’ in 2012,
                which got him a Grammy nomination. The talented D.J. and record
                producer had a talent for releasing back-to-back songs, and in
                June 2013, he released a new single called ‘Wake Me Up.’ This
                single gave Bergling more fame and success as it was the number
                one song on Spotify’s Global Chart. The record occupied the
                number one spot on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Songs list for
                14 weeks. As expected, ‘Wake Me Up’ topped the charts in many
                countries, winning him an M.T.V. E.M.A. ‘Best Electronic’ award
                in 2013 and an A.M.A. for Favorite Electronic Dance Music
                Artist.
              </p>

              <p>
                Bergling had enviable fame and success. He collaborated with
                amazing artists for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Anthem, ‘Dar um
                Jeito,’ toured multiple world countries, and released three
                studio albums. His final album, “Tim,” was released posthumously
                in April 2019. Bergling’s artistry featured E.D.M., deep house,
                and progressive house sounds. As an exceptional musician, D.J.,
                and producer, he dealt with many demons, some of which were
                alcohol and prescription drugs. He was also sensitive and
                struggled with mental health issues. Bergling committed suicide
                on April 20, 2018, at the age of 28. His remains are currently
                buried at Hedvig Elenora Church, Stockholm. Bergling is survived
                by his nuclear family and friends.

                <p>Part of the explosion of Dutch electronic music producers who emerged during the early 2010s, Martin Garrix spins a bright blend of progressive house, electro, and future bass. He broke through in 2013 with his international, multi-platinum hit "Animals" from his debut effort, Gold Skies, and hit the Billboard dance charts with EPs like 2016's Seven and 2018's Bylaw. Topping DJ rank lists in the late 2010s, Garrix has remained a global club favorite, climbing the charts with high-profile crossover collaborations with Bebe Rexha ("In the Name of Love"), Dua Lipa ("Scared to Be Lonely"), David Guetta ("So Far Away"), and Khalid ("Ocean"). He scored a gold hit with 2019's "Summer Days" featuring Macklemore and Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump, and has continued to evolve his sound, pairing with Clinton Kane on 2020's emotive "Drown" and Bono and the Edge on the 2021's high-profile single "We Are the People." In 2022, Garrix issued his first ever full-length album, Sentio.

                <p>French electronic music producer David Guetta rose to prominence atop the sparkling wave of DJs who combined Daft Punk's sleek house music with a pinch of electroclash punch at the start of the 21st century. Achieving international crossover success during the late-2000s EDM boom with chart-toppers One Love and Nothing But the Beat, his house anthems became fixtures on the dance charts into the 2010s, often featuring famous names from the worlds of pop and rap, including frequent collaborators Nicki Minaj, Sam Martin, Sia, Morten, Chris Willis, Rihanna, Kelly Rowland, and Afrojack. Along with the latter two artists, Guetta also won a pair of Grammy Awards in 2011. In 2020, he released the EP New Rave and teamed up with Sia for the ebullient international synthwave/pop hit "Let's Love." In 2022, he hit the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot 100 with "I'm Good (Blue)" featuring Bebe Rexha.

                  Electronic supergroup Swedish House Mafia house rose to prominence in the 2000s with their high-energy brand of EDM and progressive house music. Showcasing the combined talents of established DJ/producers Axwell, Steve Angello, and Sebastian Ingrosso, the group built upon their live festival buzz, scoring international hits with tracks like "One (Your Name)" featuring Pharrell Williams and "Miami 2 Ibiza" with Tinie Tempah, both of which helped 2010's Until One reach the Top Five of the U.K. and U.S. dance charts. Their sophomore compilation, 2012's Until Now, fared even better, cracking the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 and spawning the hits "Save the World" and "Don't You Worry Child" featuring John Martin. Following a five-year break to pursue solo projects, Swedish House Mafia reunited and in 2022 released their official debut album, Paradise Again.

                  As they evolved from '90s French house pioneers to 2000s dance tastemakers to mainstream heroes in the 2010s, Daft Punk remained one of dance music's most iconic acts. With their early singles and 1997's instant-classic debut album Homework, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter quickly won acclaim for their skill at blending their beloved Chicago house and Detroit techno with pop, funk, indie rock, and hip-hop into nostalgic yet futuristic forms. Not content to just widen electronic music's popularity, on 2001's Discovery they reinvented the then-unfashionable sounds of mid-'80s soft rock and R&B into stylish tracks that also had a childlike wonder. Despite their sizable popularity, Daft Punk were never afraid to challenge their listeners, which they did with 2005's cold and dystopic Human After All. Even when they polarized their audience, there was never any doubt that they staged groundbreaking concerts, and the tour captured on Alive 2007 helped pave the way for arena-sized EDM, particularly in the U.S. With 2013's Random Access Memories, the duo once again looked to the past to create the future, borrowing from prog, disco, and a laid-back West Coast vibe that bucked the predominant trends in electronic music but still resonated with a wide audience. Daft Punk's influence reached further into the mainstream through collaborations with Kanye West and the Weeknd, and the duo's music was sampled by artists ranging from Missy Elliott to the Fall. Though they reinvented themselves continually, wherever Daft Punk went, the rest of pop music followed.

                  At the forefront of electronic dance music since 2000, Grammy-winning Dutch DJ and producer Tiësto became one of the most recognizable figures of the genre with his legendary extended live sets, prolific output, and a pop-oriented crossover appeal that scored him multiple hit singles in the 2010s including "Red Lights," "Feel It in My Bones" with Tegan & Sara, "Wasted" with Matthew Koma, and "Jackie Chan" with Dzeko, Preme, and Post Malone. A Top Ten fixture in the DJ Mag Top 100 Ranking for decades, Tiësto has also accumulated numerous accolades throughout his career, including a Grammy in 2015 for his remix of John Legend's "All of Me" and a royal appointment as Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau, one of the highest honors in the Netherlands. He scored a Billboard number one Top Dance/Electronic Album with 2007's Elements of Life and cracked the Top 20 of the Billboard 200 with 2014's A Town Called Paradise. In 2020, Tiësto scored his 18th Top Ten electronic hit album with The London Sessions. He subsequently released charting collaborations with Karol G, Ava Max, and Charli XCX. Drive, his seventh full-length effort, appeared in 2023.

                  Armin van Buuren has remained one of trance and progressive house's most successful and influential figures since the late 1990s. Establishing a cinematic sound influenced by synth pioneers like Klaus Schulze and Jean Michel Jarre, he achieved chart success with early singles like 1997's "Blue Fear" before he initiated his extensive run of mix CDs. He launched the highly successful radio show A State of Trance in 2001 -- the program's weekly broadcasts, as well as its annual compilations and mix CDs, have helped maintain trance's popularity long after its commercial peak around the turn of the millennium. He co-founded Armada in 2003, and the label has similarly remained a major presence in the EDM world. Releasing a string of Dutch Top Three albums -- including 2008's Imagine, his first to chart in the U.S. -- he became a fixture on the festival circuit, renowned for his uplifting live shows. He has consistently ranked in the Top Five of DJ Magazine's Top 100 DJs poll every year since 2002, and has won scores of awards from the publication, additionally receiving a Grammy nomination for 2014's "This Is What It Feels Like." Following his 2019 studio album Balance, A State of Trance hit 1,000 episodes in 2021, and van Buuren released the two-part Feel Again in 2022.

                  Scottish producer and DJ Calvin Harris went from self-releasing his music online to selling millions in the 2000s and 2010s with radio-friendly, electronic dance crossover anthems such as "Feel So Close," "This Is What You Came For," "Slide," and "One Kiss." In addition to winning a Grammy in 2013, he also broke Michael Jackson's record for the most U.K. Top Ten singles from one album and was named Forbes' highest-earning DJ in 2013. After issuing his first two efforts -- 2007's I Created Disco and 2009's Ready for the Weekend -- he made his 2012 mainstream breakthrough with 18 Months, which recruited high-profile guest vocalists such as Rihanna, Kelis, Ellie Goulding, and Florence Welch, resulting in multiple chart hits and platinum certifications. With this successful electronic pop crossover formula, he issued the U.S. Top Five Motion in 2014 before reaching a chart peak in 2017 with the hip-hop and retro-R&B summertime hit Funk Wav Bounces, Vol. 1. More Top 20 U.K. songs followed, including 2018's "One Kiss" with Dua Lipa, 2019's "Giant" with Rag'n'Bone Man, and 2021's "By Your Side" with Tom Grennan. In 2022, he released his sixth LP, Funk Wav Bounces, Vol. 2.

                  Grammy-winning electronic producer Zedd is known for dynamic, electro-house tracks and a glitchy, pulsing production style. He first broke through in 2010 with a remix of Skrillex's "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites" before parlaying that buzz into mainstream success with his 2012 album debut, Clarity. Buoyed by the single "Stay the Night" with Hayley Williams, Clarity reached the U.S. Top Ten and earned him a Grammy for Best Dance Recording. His sophomore album, True Colors, spawned the hit "I Want You to Know" with Selena Gomez and landed at number four (plus number one on the dance charts). Along with his own work, he has remained an in-demand producer, collaborating on tracks with a bevy of pop luminaries including Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, and Ariana Grande. In 2018, he joined Grammy-winning country singer Maren Morris and L.A. electronic duo Grey for the Top 40 hit "The Middle." Over the next few years, his collaborations included 2019's "365" with Katy Perry and 2022's "Follow" with Martin Garrix.

                  Alesso, a DJ and dance music producer from Stockholm, Sweden, has achieved cross-genre success, blending progressive house with pop and scoring worldwide hits in collaboration with a wide range of artists. His earliest pop hits included 2012's "Calling (Lose My Mind)" (with Sebastian Ingrosso and Ryan Tedder) and 2013's "Under Control" (with Calvin Harris and Hurts), the latter of which reached number one in the U.K. He opened for Madonna during several British and Russian dates on her 2012 MDNA Tour, and performed at major festivals such as Coachella, Creamfields, and Electric Daisy Carnival. "Heroes (We Could Be)," a 2014 single featuring Tove Lo, became his first U.S. Top 40 hit, preceding his 2015 debut full-length, Forever. His next major international hit, 2017's "Let Me Go," was a collaboration with actress Hailee Steinfeld and country duo Florida Georgia Line.

                  Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, started their musical careers at a young age. From the age of 14, the pair began to DJ around their local nightclubs and became presenters on Belgium radio station BeatFM a few years later. They left Belgium in 1999 to play a European tour and settled in Mallorca to establish their names on the European dance circuit before moving to Halkidiki, Greece and then Ibiza in 2003. A slew of miscellaneous releases followed, but it was when their 2008 remix of Dave Lambert & Housetrap's "Work That Body" was noticed by Axwell -- who then enlisted them to remix Abel Ramos' "Rotterdam City of Love" for his label Axtone -- that DJ stardom beckoned. They hosted the Tomorrowland EDM festival in 2010, and the following year collaborated with Afrojack and Nervo on the smash single "The Way We See the World." The duo launched their Smash the House imprint in 2011. Hits and festival headlines continued, and the duo was ranked number two on DJ Magazine's Top 100 DJs poll in 2015. While Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike worked on their debut full-length in 2015, singles "The Hum" (with Ummet Ozcan) and "Higher Place" (featuring Ne-Yo) hit number one in Belgium as well as the top of the Billboard dance chart. In 2016, they collaborated with Dutch production duo W&W on the single "Arcade," which reached number one on electronic music site Beatport's Top 100 EDM songs chart, as well as hitting the Belgium and French charts. Singles such as "Melody," featuring Steve Aoki and Ummet Ozcan, and "Stay Awhile" kept the brothers in the public eye, with the pair also going one better than in the previous year's DJ Mag Top 100 DJ's second place by claiming the number one spot, the first for a duo. October saw the release of "Hey Baby," a collaboration with American producer Diplo, who had previously joined the pair at their House of Madness party in Ibiza.

                  A superstar DJ, sought-after producer, taste-making label owner, and wizard behind Major Lazer, Diplo (aka Diplodocus, Wes Diplo, and Wes Gully) launched his career on the fringes of dance music. With his mash-up mixtapes, he found and created a sound where his musical tastes -- '80s pop, electronica, Dirty South hip-hop, and his major influence, Miami bass music -- intersect. His attention-grabbing projects Hollertronix, with partner DJ Low Budget, and the 2004 Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1 mixtape, with British-Sri Lankan MC M.I.A., made a heavy impact on the alternative electro-pop scene, amassing rave reviews from music critics and indie kids alike. Later, his Mad Decent imprint presented the edge of pop, hip-hop, and dance music while his conceptual Major Lazer project mixed dancehall with rave culture and toured the globe as a live-party sound system. By the late 2010s, high-profile projects with Skrillex (Jack Ü) and Mark Ronson (Silk City) both yielded Grammy wins for collaborations with Justin Bieber and Dua Lipa, respectively. He also teamed with Labrinth and Sia to form the supergroup LSD. Heading into the 2020s, the versatile artist segued into territories ranging from country to ambient, focusing on house music through his Higher Ground imprint and his 2022 self-titled full-length.

                  DJ, producer, author, fashion designer, and label head Steve Aoki built his brand around raucous live sets, high-profile remixes and collaborations, and his indie label, Dim Mak Records. Active since the mid-'90s, his official debut album, Wonderland, received a Grammy nomination for Best Dance/Electronic Album in 2013, while subsequent releases remained a steady presence in the Top Five of the U.S. dance chart, including a pair of chart-toppers with Neon Future, Vol. 1 (2014) and Neon Future, Vol. 3 (2018). He was back in the Top 20 with Neon Future, Vol. 4 (2020). Dim Mak, founded in 1996, went on to count indie bands and electronic acts such as Gossip, Bloc Party, the Kills, Klaxons, MSTRKRFT, and Bloody Beetroots among its stable of signees. Aoki is one of the most collaborative producers around, with hundreds of features and remixes under his belt, including the Top Ten dance hits "A Light That Never Comes" featuring Linkin Park, "Just Hold On" featuring Louis Tomlinson, "All Night" featuring Lauren Jauregui, and "Waste It on Me" featuring BTS.

                  An electronic production duo featuring Andrew Taggart and Alex Pall, the Chainsmokers mix indie, dance, and pop into a chart-topping sound that's spawned no less than ten multi-platinum singles. The pair released their official debut single in 2014, a number one dance hit called "#Selfie" that both celebrated and skewered 2010s narcissism. Two Top Ten pop hits, "Roses" and the Grammy-winning "Don't Let Me Down," followed in 2016, each of them certified at least five-times platinum. "Closer," featuring Halsey on vocals, also began climbing to the top during the summer of 2016, remaining there for 12 weeks and eventually earning 12-times platinum status. In 2017, Taggart and Pall switched up their aggressive EDM approach to include more pop and indie rock touches, but they remained a platinum act with singles including 2017's "Something Just like This," featuring Coldplay. That song was included on their full-length debut, Memories: Do Not Open, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Starting in 2018, the Chainsmokers released a single each month, later collected on Sick Boy (2018) and World War Joy (2019). Following the duo's soundtrack work on 2020's Words on Bathroom Walls, they again hit the Top 40 with 2022's "High" from fourth set So Far So Good.

Building a steady following with singles and live performances, he issued his debut album, Cloud Nine, in 2016, topping charts in Europe and the U.S. and going multi-platinum in his native Norway on the strength of the single "Firestone" with Conrad Sewell. Subsequent hit singles included "It Ain't Me" with Selena Gomez, "First Time" with Ellie Goulding, and "Born to Be Yours" with Imagine Dragons. Kygo has remained at the top of the charts in Norway with albums like 2017's Kids in Love and 2020's Golden Hour, the latter of which reached number 18 on the Billboard 200. In 2022, he surprised fans with his unannounced fourth album, The Thrill of the Chase, which returned him to the upper echelon of the dance charts.

                  Skrillex emerged as one of dance music's most popular artists during the EDM explosion of the early 2010s, and he's retained that status in addition to becoming a high-profile pop producer. Formerly the frontman of post-hardcore band From First to Last, Sonny Moore began making brash, bombastic dance music under the name Skrillex at the end of the 2000s, heavily influenced by electro-house and the rowdier side of dubstep, but also incorporating influences from metal, hip-hop, dancehall, and other genres. His sudden success introduced dubstep to mainstream American audiences (though his music was associated with a more aggressive variant referred to as brostep), and he won several Grammy Awards for early EPs Scary Monsters & Nice Sprites (2010) and Bangarang (2011). His music branched out into other styles such as trap and moombahton, and he formed duos with Boys Noize (Dog Blood) and Diplo (Jack Ü); the latter released a Grammy-winning full-length in 2015. Skrillex's own debut album, Recess, appeared in 2014, and he remained busy as a solo artist and producer, racking up credits on albums by Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey, Lady Gaga, and Beyoncé, among many others. Two guest-heavy Skrillex albums, Quest for Fire and Don't Get Too Close, appeared nearly simultaneously in 2023.

                  British-Norwegian EDM producer Alan Walker was a mere 18 years old when his track "Faded" became a massive European hit, topping the charts in ten countries and entering the Top Five in six more. The song paved the way for his debut album, 2018's Different World, which also hit number one in Norway. He again reached the upper echelon of the Norwegian charts with 2021's World of Walker.

                  A Grammy-nominated producer, France's DJ Snake is at the forefront of the electronic trap music movement, having taken the genre to the charts with his 2013 single "Turn Down for What" featuring Lil Jon. He scored an additional mainstream hit with 2015's "Lean On," a multi-platinum, global chart-topper that featured Major Lazer and vocalist MØ, before topping that song's success with 2016's Justin Bieber collaboration "Let Me Love You," off Snake's Top Ten Billboard 200-charting debut, Encore. He has remained a chart regular, landing at number one on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums list with 2019's Carte Blanche. The record also spawned the dance hits "Taki Taki" with Selena Gomez, Cardi B, and Ozuna, and "Fuego" with Sean Paul, Anitta, and Tainy. In 2021, he again joined Gomez for her song "Selfish Love" before reuniting with Ozuna (as well as Megan Thee Stallion and BlackPink's Lisa) for the Top Ten dance single "SG."

                  Swedish DJ and producer Eric Prydz releases singles and EPs under a variety of project names, including Pryda, Cirez D, Sheridan, Dirty Funker, Moo, A and P Project, Axer, Hardform, Dukes of Sluca, and Groove System. Most of these singles are released on his own labels, which include Mouseville, Pryda, and Pryda Friends. Under his own name, however, Prydz favors straightforward, club-oriented house with a line in remakes of mildly cheesy pop songs from the 1980s. Prydz's first release in this style was 2004's "Call on Me," a sensation in Europe upon its release. Built on the hook from Steve Winwood's 1987 hit "Valerie" (with new vocals by Winwood), "Call on Me" hit the top of the singles chart in both England and Germany, spurred in large part by a somewhat controversial video consisting of an overtly sexual aerobic routine that had no less a personage than U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair publicly commenting on its salaciousness. Prydz followed this in 2005 with "Woz Not Woz," a beat-heavy instrumental revamp of the 1980 Was (Not Was) single "Wheel Me Out" that was less commercially successful but more musically inventive. This was followed in 2006 by "Proper Education," a remake of Pink Floyd's smash "Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2" that set David Gilmour and the schoolchildren chorus to a considerably funkier backbeat. Prydz continued to issue singles on Pryda for the next few years, culminating in 2012's triple-disc Eric Prydz Presents Pryda. New material was presented on disc one, while discs two and three featured past material edited and mixed by Prydz. In 2015 he issued "Opus," a nine-minute, building track that became a hit, and then made news when Kieran Hebden, aka left-field producer Four Tet, tweeted out a request to do a remix. The request was granted, and in 2016, "Opus" became the title track to Prydz's debut studio album.
